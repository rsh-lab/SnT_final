The notebook creates a plot of EMA and SMA of the stock Larsen and Turbo (Nifty 50).
After caclulating the Simple Moving Averages, stored as a list under 'sma',
I have caclulated the EMAs directly using ewm function of numpy. It is stored under ewm1
Later on I have written down the mathermatics and again calculated the EMAs. Both the plots have been shown.
There is a minor discrepancy in the last value of the EMAs got using these two methods.
Currently working on figuring that out.
